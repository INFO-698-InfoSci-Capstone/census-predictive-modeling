Week 14

Roses:
* Overall, set up the CBI analysis & began some KDD - clocked about 30 hours for week 14

Buds:
* Looking forward to tuning the weights

Thorns:
* Blocker - Fall 2021 was missing for IAS, took a few days to get it - resolved
* Missing data for DR - still open
* Adding CBI so late in the game, I'm concerned my findings won't be as strong since I did most of the set-up for trend analysis
