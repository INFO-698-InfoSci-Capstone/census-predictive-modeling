Week 11:

Roses:

•	Team sync: defined labor split based on our defined research questions 

•	SOW: mostly finished the SOW document. Sindhu & Ram Teja completed most of it (before we had agreed when to do it & who). I’ve spent about 3 hours on the SOW editing it & creating the Gantt chart

•	Sean Sync – overall liked our strategy for moving forward, he gave some suggestions

•	Data cleaning – performed some additional data cleaning based on Sean’s suggestions from the week before

    Accomplished: getting rid of: honors, independent study, class status code

•	(Ram Teja began some KDD for our defined modalities) this will allow me to start working on trend analysis over the weekend

Buds:

•	Data cleaning: figuring out the 2 new DFs (Undergrad vs Grad, Online vs In Person) this weekend

•	Beginning trend analysis soon!


Thorns:

•	Having issues with creating the new DFs - I must be missing something iterating through the dictionaries

     If I can't get the for-loop to work, I may just write some manual code (ugly, but it'll work)

•	Teammates missed our weekly sync with Sean. This is the second time they’ve missed a Sean sync.

•	I missed one of our team syncs, rescheduled to the following day

•	I had low availability this week due to 2 assignments in my other (1) course, otherwise I would’ve made more coding headway.
