Week 13:

Roses:
   * Overall completed the KDD by Modality! Modalities include: 1) In-Person vs Online, 2) 15-week vs 7-week, 3) Days Scheduled, 4) Time of Day

Buds:
   * Connect with Sean about my KDD analysis - will be pivoting to focus on Days Scheduled and Time of Day since they more closely align with our Course Bottleneck Index
   * Received data from Sean to complete Instructor Load Factor & Prerequisite Complexity Score.

Thorns:
   *I'm a little concerned about starting the Course Bottleneck Index, after spending ~60 hours on the code for preparing our trend analysis. I shared my concerns with my mentor. At this point, I figure CBI is "just another model" I would've built anyway. I will dive into the CBI scope this weekend & feel hopeful that the work I've already completed will be harmonious with the new CBI expectation.
