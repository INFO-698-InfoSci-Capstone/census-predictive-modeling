Week 15

Roses:
 * Completed tuning the weights
 * Tuned the weights with a Correlation Analysis as well as a Random Forest Analysis. For "total", they shared 99% similar results, and for "by term" they shared 96% similarities. Because the outputs were so similar, I'm choosing to use the Random Forest weights to incorporate some AI in the project.
 * Ran CBI analysis for both the Correlation Analysis & Random Forest Analysis - but will be using Random Forest for moving forward
 * Began a new file for actionable insights. This is where I'm expecting my poster results to come from.
 * Analyses for highlighting problem courses completed:
    - By Total: alphabetical, by score, grouped by score, graphed the distribution of scores
    - By Term: by Term order & alphabetical, by Term order & descending CBI score, found classes with persisntently high scores
 * Performed some Trend CBI analysis

Buds:
 * Continue & finish Actionable Insights
 * Analyses for highlight problem courses to-do
    - By Term: Delta Analysis, by course, what's the term-to-term change 
 * Analyses for CBI Factors
    - By Total: analyze CBI factor by Course Description
    - By Term: 1) analyze CBI factor by Course Description 2) What factors are driving CBI spikes between semesters?
 * Analysis for Trend CBI: how does the factors' influence change between semesters>

Thorns:
 * Requested flexibility on the Poster Draft Due Date to be due Sunday instead of Friday, given the capstone group split
 * Only one week left to work on it
