Week 10:

Roses:
•	Spent 16 hours on data cleaning
•	Produced fall_all, spring_all, and df_all to begin the KDD process (uploaded to Box, not yet Github)
•	Team Sync – refined research questions
•	Mentor Sync – additional data cleansing ideas

Bud:
•	Looking forward to implementing Sean's data cleansing ideas:
        Getting rid of: honors, independent study, class status code
        New DFs to make: Undergrad vs Grad, Online vs In Person

Thorns:
•	Teammates were not checking either email/Slack daily. There was 3 days without any replies, I had to text them to check their email/Slack for their outstanding tasks, otherwise we wouldn’t have been prepared for our meeting with Sean. Set communication standards a second time, to check Slack & email daily, and if you cannot reply immediately to then reply that they’ve seen the message and are working on a reply.
